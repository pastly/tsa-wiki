## weasel

 * Started with new onionoo hosts.  Currently there's just one backend
   on fsn, irl is doing the service part (cf. #31659)
 * puppet cleanup: nameserver/hoster info

## Hiro

 * Setup dip so that it can be easily rebased with debian upstream
 * Migrated gettor from getulum to gettor-01
 * Random upgrades and reboots
 * Moving all my services to ansible or packages (no ad - hoc
   configuration):
     - Gettor can be deployed and updated via ansible
     - Survey should be deployed and updated via ansible
     - Gitlab (dip) is already on ansible
     - Schleuder should be maintained via packages
 * Nagios checks for gettor

## ln5

Didn't do much. :(

## qbi

Didn't do volunteering due to private stuff

# What we're up to next

## anarcat

New:

 * LDAP sudo transition ([#6367][])
 * jabber service shutdown ([#31700][])
 * considering unattended-upgrades or at least automated needrestart
   deployment ([#31957][])
 * followup on the various ops report card things ([#30881][])
 * maybe deploy puppetboard as a Puppet Dashboard ([#31969][]),
   possibly moving puppetdb to a separate machine
 * nbg1/prometheus stability issues, ipsec seems to be the problem
   ([#31916][])

Continuing/stalled:

 * director replacement ([#31786][])
 * taking a break on hiera refactoring ([#30020][])
 * send root@ emails to RT ([#31242][])

 * ansible recipe to manage survey.tp.o
 * dev portal coding in lektor
 * finishing moving gettor to gettor-01 includes gettor-web via lektor

Nextcloud migration.

# Other discussions

## configuration management systems

We discussed the question of the "double tools problem" that seems to
be coming up with the configuration management system: most systems
are managed with Puppet, but some services are deployed with
Puppet. It was argued it might be preferable to use Puppet everywhere
to ease onboarding, since it would be one less tool to learn. But that
might require giving people root, or managing services ourselves,
which is currently out of the question. So it was agreed it's better
to have services managed with ansible than not managed at all...

# Next meeting

We're changing the time because 1400UTC would be too early for anarcat
because of daylight savings. We're pushing to 1500UTC, which is
1600CET and 1000EST.

# Metrics of the month

Access and transfer rates are an average over the last 15 days.

 * hosts in Puppet: 79, LDAP: 82, Prometheus exporters: 106
 * number of apache servers monitored: 26, hits per second: 177
 * number of self-hosted nameservers: 4, mail servers: 10
 * pending upgrades: 0, reboots: 0
 * average load: 0.51, memory available: 318.82 GiB/871.81 GiB,
   running processes: 379
 * bytes sent: 134.28 MB/s, received: 94.38 MB/s

Now also available as the main Grafana dashboard. Head to
<https://grafana.torproject.org/>, change the time period to 7 days,
and wait a while for results to render.

Note that the retention period of the Prometheus server has been
reduced from 30 to 15 days to address stability issues with the server
(ticket #31916), so far without luck.
