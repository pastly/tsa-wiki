# Bits and pieces of Tor Project infrastructure information

A collection of information looking for a better place, perhaps after
being expanded a bit to deserve their own page.

## Backups

* We use [[Bacula|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacula]] to make
  backups, with one host running a director (currently dictyotum.tpo)
  and another host for storage (currently brulloi.tpo).
* There are `BASE` files and `WAL` files, the latter for incremental
  backups.
* The logs found in `/var/log/bacula-main.log` and `/var/log/bacula/`
  seem mostly empty, just like the systemd journals.

### Servers

* There's one `director` and one `storage node`.

* The director runs `/usr/local/sbin/dsa-bacula-scheduler` which reads
  `/etc/bacula/dsa-clients` for a list of clients to back up. This
  file is populated by puppet (puppetdb
  `$bacula::tag_bacula_dsa_client_list`) and will list clients until
  they're being deactivated in puppet.

### Clients
* `tor-puppet/modules/bacula/manifests/client.pp` gives an idea of
  where things are at on backup clients.
* Clients run the Bacula File Daemon, `bacula-fd(8)`.

## Onion sites

- Example from a vhost template

    <% if scope.function_onion_global_service_hostname(['crm-2018.torproject.org']) -%>
    <Virtualhost *:80>
        ServerName <%= scope.function_onion_global_service_hostname(['crm-2018.torproject.org']) %>
        Use vhost-inner-crm-2018.torproject.org
    </VirtualHost>
    <% end -%>

- Function defined in
  `tor-puppet/modules/puppetmaster/lib/puppet/parser/functions/onion_global_service_hostname.rb`
  parses
  `/srv/puppet.torproject.org/puppet-facts/onionbalance-services.yaml`.
- `onionbalance-services.yaml` is populated through
  `onion::balance` (`tor-puppet/modules/onion/manifests/balance.pp`)
- `onion:balance` uses the `onion_balance_service_hostname` fact from `tor-puppet/modules/torproject_org/lib/facter/onion-services.rb`
