How to get help
===============

Those instructions concern mostly internal Tor matters. For users of
Tor software, you will be better served by visiting
[support.torproject.org](https://support.torproject.org/) or [mailing lists](https://lists.torproject.org/).

Quick question: IRC
-------------------

If you have "just a quick question" or some quick thing we can help
you with, ask us on IRC: you can find us in `#tpo-admin` on
`irc.oftc.net` and in other tor channels.

It's possible we ask you to create a ticket if we're in a pinch. It's
also a good way to bring your attention to some emergency or ticket
that was filed elsewhere.

Bug reports, feature requests and others: Trac
----------------------------------------------

Most requests and questions should go into [Trac](https://trac.torproject.org) ([direct link to
a new ticket form](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/newticket). Try to find the right component, but when in
doubt, pick [Internal Services/Tor Sysadmin Team](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/newticket?component=Internal+Services%2FTor+Sysadmin+Team).

Private question and fallback: email
------------------------------------

If you want to discuss a sensitive matter that requires privacy or are
unsure how to reach us, you can always write to us by email, at
[torproject-admin@torproject.org](mailto:torproject-admin@torproject.org).
