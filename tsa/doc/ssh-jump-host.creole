= learning how to do an ssh jump host on tpo =

An ssh jump host is an alternative to SSH tunneling to access internal machines at tpo.
ProxyCommand automatically executes ssh command on remote host to jump to the next host and forward all traffic through.

Ex: To perform a ssh jump host and access staticiforme.tpo you might add the following to your ~/.ssh/config

{{{
Host staticiforme.torproject.org
ProxyCommand ssh -l %r -W %h:%p perdulce.torproject.org

untested, for your ~/.ssh/config
}}}
