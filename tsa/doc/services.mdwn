[[!meta title="Running non-root services"]]

Service on TPO machines are often ran as regular users, from normal
sessions, instead of the usual `/etc/init.d` or `systemd`
configuration provided by Debian packages. This is part of our
[[service vs system admin distinction|admins]].

This page aims at documenting how such services are started and
managed. There are many ways this can be done: many services have been
started as a `@reboot` cronjob in the past, but we're looking at using
`systemd --user` as a more reasonable way to do this in the future.

systemd startup
===============

Most Debian machines now run [systemd](http://manpages.debian.org/systemd) which allows all sorts of
neat tricks. In particular, it allows us to start programs as a normal
user through a `systemd --user` session that gets started
automatically at boot.

## Adding a new service

User-level services are deployed in `~/.config/systemd/user/`. Let's
say we're deploying a `bridgescan` service. You'd need to craft a
[.service file](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/systemd/systemd.service.5.en.html) and drop it in
`~/.config/systemd/user/bridgescan.service`. Then you can issue:

    systemctl --user daemon-reload

For the new file to be notified.

If you're getting an error like this:

    Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory

It's because your environment is not setup correctly and `systemctl`
can't find the correct sockets. Try to set the `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`
environment to the right user directory:

    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/2136

Then the service can be enabled:

    systemctl --user enable bridgescan

And then started:

    systemctl --user start bridgescan

## sysadmin stuff

On the sysadmin side, to enable `systemd --user` session, we need to
run `loginctl enable-linger $USER`. For example, this will enable the
session for the `bridgescan` user:

    exec {
      'loginctl enable-linger bridgescan':
        creates => '/var/lib/systemd/linger/bridgescan';
    }

This will create an empty file for the user in
`/var/lib/systemd/linger/` but it will *also* start the `systemd
--user` session immediately, which can already be used to start other
processes.

cron startup
============

This method is now discouraged, but is still in use for older
services.

Failing `systemd` or admin support, you might be able to start
services at boot time with a [cron](https://manpages.debian.org/cron) job.

The trick is to edit the role account crontab with `sudo -u role
crontab -e` and then adding a line like:

    @reboot /home/role/bin/service start

It is deprecated because `cron` is not a service manager and has no
way to restart the service easily on upgrades. It also lacks features
like socket activation or restart on failure that systemd
provides. Plus it won't *actually* start the service until the machine
is rebooted, that's just plain silly.
