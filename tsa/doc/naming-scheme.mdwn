Domain name scheme
==================

Tor uses two main domain names for things:

 * `torproject.org`
 * `torproject.net`

There might be other domains managed by us or registered in the DNS,
but they should eventually point to one of those, generally
`torproject.org`.

All TPA-managed machines and services on those machines should be
under `torproject.org`. The naming scheme of the individual machines
is detailed below. This is managed by TPA directly through
[[howto/dns]].

External services and machines *can* be hosted under
`torproject.net`. In that case, the only association is a `CNAME` or
`A` record pointing to the other machine. To get such a record,
contact TPA using the normal communication channels detailed in
[[how-to-get-help]].

Machine naming scheme
=====================

There are multiple naming schemes in use:

 * onion species
 * role-based
 * location-based

Onion species
-------------

[Wikipedia list of onion species][], preferably picking a first letter
matching purpose (e.g. "m" for monitoring, "b" for backups, "p" for
puppet) and ideally not overlapping with [existing machines at
debian.org][] in the first three letters or at least the short
hostname part

[Wikipedia list of onion species]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Allium_species
[existing machines at debian.org]: https://db.debian.org/machines.cgi

> Example: monticola.torproject.org was picked as a "monitoring"
> ("mon") server to run the experimental Prometheus server. no
> machine is named "monticola" at Debian.org and no machine has
> "mon" or smaller as its first three letters there either.

Role
----

Another naming scheme is `role-ID`, where:

 * `role` is what the server is for, for example `gitlab`, `mon` for
   monitoring, `crm`, etc. try to keep it short and abbreviate to
   at most three letters if role is longer than five. `role` might
   have a dash (`-`) in it to describe the service better (`crm-ext`
   vs `crm-int`)
 * `ID` is a two-character number, padded with zero, starting from
   one, to distinguish between multiple instances of the same server
   (e.g. `mon-01`, `mon-02`)

Location
--------

Another naming scheme used for virtual machines is `hoster-locN-ID`
(example `hetzner-hel1-01`), where:

 * `hoster`: is the hosting provider (example `hetzner`)
 * `locN`: is the three-letter code of the city where the machine is
   located, followed by a digit in case there are multiple locations
   in the same city (e.g. `hel1`)
 * `ID`: is an two-character number, padded with zero, starting from
   one, to distinguish multiple instances at the same location

This is used for virtual machines at Hetzner that are bound to a
specific location.
