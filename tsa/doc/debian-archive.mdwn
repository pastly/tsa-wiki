Internal Debian archive operations
----------------------------------

Packages should be uploaded to: 

    alberti.torproject.org:/srv/db.torproject.org/ftp-archive/archive/pool/tpo-all/

Then to install the packages:

    ssh alberti.tpo make -C /srv/db.torproject.org/ftp-archive

This might require fixing some permissions. Do a `chmod g+w` on the
broken directories if this happens and open a ticket if it does, to
create a service account instead of that hack.
