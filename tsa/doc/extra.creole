= When using extra.tpo =

Extra is one of the sites hosted by "the www rotation". The www rotation uses several computers to host
its websites and it is used within tpo for redundancy.

Extra is used to host images that can be linked in blog posts and the like. The idea is that you do not need to
link images from your own computer or people.tpo.

Extra is used like other static sites within tpo.
