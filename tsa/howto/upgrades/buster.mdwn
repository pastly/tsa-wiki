Procedure
=========

 1. Preperation:

        : reset to the default locale
        export LANG=C.UTF-8 &&
        sudo apt install ttyrec screen debconf-utils apt-show-versions deborphan &&
        sudo ttyrec -e screen /var/log/upgrade-buster.ttyrec

 2. Backups and checks:

        ( umask 0077 &&
          tar cfz /var/backups/pre-buster-backup.tgz /etc /var/lib/dpkg /var/lib/apt/extended_states /var/cache/debconf &&
          dpkg --get-selections "*" > /var/backups/dpkg-selections-pre-buster.txt &&
          debconf-get-selections > /var/backups/debconf-selections-pre-buster.txt &&
          apt-mark showhold) &&
        dpkg --audit &&
        : look for dkms packages and make sure they are relevant, if not, purge. &&
        ( dpkg -l '*dkms' || true ) &&
        : make sure backups are up to date in Nagios

 2. Perform any pending upgrade and clear out old pins:

        : Check for pinned (on hold) packages, and possibly disable &&
        rm -f /etc/apt/preferences /etc/apt/preferences.d/* &&
        rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/testing.list &&
        rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stretch-backports.list &&
        apt update && apt -y upgrade &&
        : list kernel images and purge unused packages &&
        dpkg -l 'linux-image-*' &&
        : look for packages from backports, other suites or archives &&
        : if possible, switch to official packages by disabling third-party repositories &&
        apt-show-versions | grep -v /stretch | grep -v 'not installed$'

 3. Check free space, see [this guide to free up space][] and
    download packages:

        sed -i 's/stretch/buster/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* &&
        rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.debian.org.list &&
        apt update &&
        apt -y -d upgrade &&
        apt -y -d dist-upgrade

 4. Actual upgrade run:

        apt install -y dpkg apt &&
        apt dist-upgrade &&
        : ferm will fail until the next reboot

 5. Reboot, then fix ferm:

        reboot

        dpkg --configure -a

 6. Post-upgrade procedures:

        apt-mark manual git &&
        apt purge $(for i in apt-transport-https dh-python emacs24-nox gnupg-agent libatomic1 libbind9-140 libcryptsetup4 libdns-export162 libdns162 libevent-2.0-5 libevtlog0 libgdbm3 libicu57 libisc-export160 libisc160 libisccc140 libisccfg140 libjansson4 liblvm2app2.2 liblvm2cmd2.02 liblwres141 libmpfr4 libncurses5 libperl5.24 libprocps6 libpython3.5 libpython3.5-minimal libpython3.5-stdlib libruby2.3 libssl1.0.2 libunbound2 libunistring0 libxslt1.1 libyajl2 python3-distutils python3-lib2to3 python3.5 python3.5-minimal ruby-nokogiri ruby-pkg-config ruby-rgen ruby-safe-yaml ruby2.3 sgml-base xml-core git-core gcc-6-base:amd64 nagios-plugins-basic perl-modules-5.24; do dpkg -l "$i" 2>/dev/null | grep -q '^ii' && echo "$i"; done) &&
        (puppet agent -t || true) &&
        (puppet agent -t || true)

 7. Post-upgrade checks:

        dsa-check-packages
        while deborphan -n | grep -q . ; do apt purge $(deborphan -n); done
        apt --purge autoremove
        dpkg -l '*-dbg' # look for dbg package and possibly replace with -dbgsym
        apt clean
        reboot
        # review and purge older kernel once the new one boots properly
        dpkg -l 'linux-image*'
        # review packages that are not in the new distribution
        apt-show-versions | grep -v /buster

 8. Change the hostgroup of the host to buster in Nagios (in
    `tor-nagios/config/nagios-master.cfg` on `git@git-rw.tpo`)

Issues
======

Pending
-------

 * the following config files had conflicts but were managed by Puppet
   so those changes were ignored for now. eventually they should be
   upgraded in Puppet as well.

        /etc/bacula/bacula-fd.conf
        /etc/bind/named.conf.options
        /etc/default/stunnel4
        /etc/ferm/ferm.conf
        /etc/init.d/stunnel4
        /etc/logrotate.d/ulogd2
        /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg
        /etc/ntp.conf
        /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf

 * ferm failed to reload during upgrade, with the following error:
 
        Couldn't load match `state':No such file or directory

 * Puppet will warn with the following when running against a stretch
   master, harmlessly:
   
        Warning: Downgrading to PSON for future requests

 * Puppet might try to downgrade the `sources.list` files to `stretch`
   or `n/a` for some reason, just re-run Puppet after fixing the
   `sources.list` files, it will eventually figure it out.

 * The official list of [known issues][]
