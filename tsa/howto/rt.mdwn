Creating a queue
----------------

On the RT web interface:

 1. authenticate to <https://rt.torproject.org/>
 2. head to the [Queue creation form](https://rt.torproject.org/Admin/Queues/Modify.html?Create=1) (Admin -> Queues -> Create)
 3. pick a Queue Name, set the `Reply Address` to
    `QUEUENAME@rt.torproject.org` and leave the `Comment Address`
    blank
 4. hit the `Create` button
 5. grant a group access to the queue, in the `Group rights` tab
    ([create a group](https://rt.torproject.org/Admin/Groups/Modify.html?Create=1) if necessary) - you want to grant the
    following to the group
    * all "General rights"
    * in "Rights for staff":
      * Delete tickets (`DeleteTicket`)
      * Forward messages outside of RT (`ForwardMessage`)
      * Modify ticket owner on owned tickets (`ReassignTicket`)
      * Modify tickets (`ModifyTicket`)
      * Own tickets (`OwnTicket`)
      * Sign up as a ticket or queue AdminCc (`WatchAsAdminCc`)
      * Take tickets (`TakeTicket`)
      * View exact outgoing email messages and their recipients (`ShowOutgoingEmail`)
      * View ticket private (`commentary `)
      That is, everything but:
      * Add custom field values only at object creation time (`SetInitialCustomField`)
      * Modify custom field values (`ModifyCustomField`)
      * Steal tickets (`StealTicket`)
 6. if the queue is public (and it most likely is), grant the
    following to the `Everyone`, `Privileged`, and `Unprivileged`
    groups:
      * Create tickets (`CreateTicket`)
      * Reply to tickets (`ReplyToTicket`)

On the RT server (currently `rude`):

 1. edit the `/etc/aliases` file to add a line like:

        rt-QUEUENAME: rtmailarchive+QUEUENAME,      "|/usr/bin/rt-mailgate --queue QUEUENAME --action correspond --url https://rt.torproject.org/"

 2. regenerate the alias database:
    
        newaliases

 3. add an entry in the virtual table (`/etc/postfix/virtual`):
    
        QUEUENAME@rt.torproject.org rt-QUEUENAME

 4. regenerate the virtual database:
 
        postmap /etc/postfix/virtual

In Puppet:

 1. add an entry in the main mail server virtual file (currently
    `tor-puppet/modules/postfix/files/virtual`) like:
    
        QUEUENAME@torproject.org         QUEUENAME@rt.torproject.org

TODO: the above should be automated. Ideally,
`QUEUENAME@rt.torproject.org` should be an alias that automatically
sends the message to the relevant `QUEUENAME`. That way, RT admins can
create Queues without requiring the intervention of a sysadmin.
