- dehydrated is now being run on DNS master (nevii.tpo), see the
  `letsencrypt` user and `/srv/letsencrypt`.
- Resulting keys and certs are being copied to the LDAP host
  (currently pauli.tpo) under
  `/srv/puppet.torproject.org/from-letsencrypt/`, from where they're
  being picked up by the host running the service somehow.
- FIXME: and then what?
