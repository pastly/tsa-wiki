IRC is the original [Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), one the first (1988)
protocol created for "chatting" in real-time on the Internet, and the
oldest one still in use. It is also one of the oldest protocols still
active on the internet, predating the web by a few years.

This page is mostly a discussion of software that runs *on top* of IRC
and operated by end users.

# Tutorial

Tor makes extensive use of IRC with multiple active channels on the
[OFTC network](https://www.oftc.net/). Our user-visible documentation is at [this wiki
page](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/onboarding/IRC).

# Howto

We do not operate the OFTC network. The public support channel for
OFTC is `#oftc`.

# Reference

We do operate a virtual machine for people to run their IRC clients,
called `chives`. The previous host running that service is called
`iranicum` and is still online at the time of writing.

## Installation

The new IRC server has been setup with the `roles::ircbox` by weasel
(see [ticket #32281](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/32281)) in october 2019, to replace the older
machine. This role simply sets up the machine as a "shell server"
(`roles::shell`) and installs `irssi`.

## SLA

No specific SLA has been set for this service

## Design

Just a regular Debian server with users from LDAP.

## Issues

No specific project has been created to track issues.

# Discussion

This page was originally created to discuss the implementation of
"bouncer" services for other staff. While many people run IRC clients
on the server over an SSH connexion, this is inconvenient for people
less familiar with the commandline. 

It was therefore suggested we evaluate other systems to allow users to
have more "persistence" online without having to overcome the
"commandline" hurdle.

## Goals

### Must have

 * user-friendly way to stay connected to IRC

### Nice to have

 * web interface?
 * LDAP integration?

### Non-Goals

 * replacing IRC (let's not go there please)

## Approvals required

Maybe checking with TPA before setting up a new service, if any.

## Proposed Solution

Not decided yet.

## Cost

Staff. Existing hardware resources can be reused.

## Alternatives considered

 * [irssi](https://irssi.org/) in some terminal multiplexer like [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)
   or [dtach](https://irssi.org/)
 * [weechat](https://weechat.org/) in the same or with another [interface](https://weechat.org/about/interfaces/)
 * [lounge](https://thelounge.chat/) webchat (nodejs, not packaged in Debian)
 * [ZNC](https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC), a [bouncer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_%28software%29#IRC)
 * a Matrix gateway like [Riot.IM](https://about.riot.im/)

### Discarded alternatives

Most other alternatives have been discarded because they do not work
with IRC and we do not wish to move away from that platform just
yet. Other projects (like [qwebirc](https://thelounge.chat/)) were discarded because they do
not offer persistence.

Free software projects:

 * [Briar](https://briarproject.org/) - tor-based offline-first messenger
 * [Jabber/XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) - just shutdown the service, never picked up
 * [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) - audio, video, text chat
 * [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) - opensource alternative to slack, not federated
 * [Retroshare](https://retroshare.cc/) - old, complex, not packaged
 * [Rocket.chat](https://rocket.chat/) - not federated
 * [Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) - not a great messaging experience
 * [Signal](https://signal.org/) - in use at Tor, but poor group chat capabilities
 * [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) - [doubts about security reliability](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=767418#42)
 * [Tox](https://tox.chat/) - DHT-based chat system
 * [Wire](https://wire.com/) - not packaged in Debian
 * [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/) - "team chat", not federated

Yes, that's an incredibly long list, and probably not exhaustive.

Commercial services:

 * [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com/) - bridges with IRC
 * [Slack](https://slack.com/) - poor privacy
 * [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) - voice and chat app, mostly for gaming
 * [Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) - Google service
 * Whatsapp - tied to Facebook
 * Skype - Microsoft
 * [Keybase](https://alternativeto.net/software/keybase/) - OpenPGP-encrypted chat, proprietary server-side

None of the commercial services interoperate with IRC unless otherwise noted.
