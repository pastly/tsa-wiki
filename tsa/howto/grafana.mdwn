Grafana
=======

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is a graphing engine and dashboard management tool that
processes data from multiple data sources. We use it to trend various
metrics collected from servers by [[Prometheus]].

Puppet implementation
---------------------

Grafana was installed with Puppet using the upstream Debian
package, following a debate regarding the merits of Debian packages
versus Docker containers when neither are trusted, see [this
comment](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/29684#comment:3) for a summary.

Manual configuration was performed after the installed:

 1. admin password reset on first install, stored in
    `torr-passwords.git`, in `hosts-extra-info`.

 2. Prometheus datasource configured by hand

 3. 5 dashboards imported and configured by hand

Those should be integrated in the Puppet configuration and
authentication needs to be figured out.
