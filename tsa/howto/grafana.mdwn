Grafana
=======

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is a graphing engine and dashboard management tool that
processes data from multiple data sources. We use it to trend various
metrics collected from servers by [[Prometheus]].

Puppet implementation
---------------------

Grafana was installed with Puppet using the upstream Debian
package, following a debate regarding the merits of Debian packages
versus Docker containers when neither are trusted, see [this
comment](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/29684#comment:3) for a summary.

Some manual configuration was performed after the install. An admin
password reset on first install, stored in `torr-passwords.git`, in
`hosts-extra-info`. Everything else is configured in Puppet.

Grafana dashboards, in particular, live in
`modules/profile/files/grafana/dashboards`, which is a copy of
anarcat's [grafana-dashboards repository](https://gitlab.com/anarcat/grafana-dashboards). The `README.md` file
there contains more instructions on how to add and update
dashboards. In general, dashboards must not be modified directly
through the web interface, at least not without being exported back
into the repository.
