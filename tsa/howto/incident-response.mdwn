Server down
===========

If a server is non-responsive, you can first check if it is actually
reachable over the network:

    ping -c 10 server.torproject.org

If it does respond, you can try to diagnose the issue by looking at
[Nagios][] and/or [Grafana](https://grafana.torproject.org) and analyse what, exactly is going on.

[Nagios]: https://nagios.torproject.org

If it does *not* respond, you should see if it's a virtual machine,
and in this case, which server is hosting it. This information is
available in [[ldap]] (or [the web interface](https://db.torproject.org/machines.cgi), under the
`physicalHost` field. Then login to that server to diagnose this
issue.

If the physical host is not responding or is empty (in which case it
*is* a physical host), you need to file a ticket with the upstream
provider. This information is available in [Nagios][]: 

 1. search for the server name in the search box
 2. click on the server
 3. drill down the "Parents" until you find something that ressembles
    a hosting provider (e.g. `hetzner-hel1-01` is Hetzner, `gw-cymru`
    is Cymru, `gw-scw-*` are at Scaleway, `gw-sunet` is Sunet)
