"Retiring" a user can actually mean two things:

 * "retired", which disables their access to Tor hosts but keeps
   email working and then automatically stops after 186 days

 * "disabled", which immediately disables everything

# How to retire a user

This is done by "locking" the account in [[ldap]], so it should simply
be:

    ssh alberti.torproject.org ud-lock account

# How to disable a user

This is done by removing all traces of the account:

 1. Login to alberti.torproject.org and lock the LDAP account using `ud-info -u`
 2. Login as admin to trac.torproject.org and disable the user account.
 3. Login to eugeni.torproject.org.
    - edit `/etc/postfix/virtual` and remove the account alias.
    - run `sudo postmap virtual` to rebuild the virtual users table.
    - run `sudo remove_members <list names> <email address>`
 4. make sure they don't have keys and accounts in Puppet
