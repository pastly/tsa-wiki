Listing all hosts under puppet
==============================

The following will list all hosts under Puppet and their `virtual`
value:

    ssh -t pauli.torproject.org "sudo -u postgres psql puppetdb -P pager=off -F',' -A -t -c \"SELECT c.certname, value_string FROM factsets fs INNER JOIN facts f ON f.factset_id = fs.id INNER JOIN fact_values fv ON fv.id = f.fact_value_id INNER JOIN fact_paths fp ON fp.id = f.fact_path_id INNER JOIN certnames c ON c.certname = fs.certname WHERE fp.name = 'virtual' AND c.deactivated IS NULL\""  | tee hosts.csv

The resulting file is a Comma-Seperated Value (CSV) file which can be
used for other purposes later.

Possible values of the `virtual` field can be obtain with a similar
query:
    
    ssh -t pauli.torproject.org "sudo -u postgres psql puppetdb -P pager=off -A -t -c \"SELECT DISTINCT value_string FROM factsets fs INNER JOIN facts f ON f.factset_id = fs.id INNER JOIN fact_values fv ON fv.id = f.fact_value_id INNER JOIN fact_paths fp ON fp.id = f.fact_path_id WHERE fp.name = 'virtual';\""

The currently known values are: `kvm`, `physical`, and `xenu`.

## Other ways of extracting a host list

 * Using the PuppetDB API:

        curl -s -G http://localhost:8080/pdb/query/v4/facts  | jq -r ".[].certname"

 * Using [Cumin](https://doc.wikimedia.org/cumin/master/introduction.html)

 * Using LDAP:
 
        HOSTS=$(ssh alberti.torproject.org 'ldapsearch -h db.torproject.org -x -ZZ -b dc=torproject,dc=org -LLL "hostname=*.torproject.org" hostname | awk "\$1 == \"hostname:\" {print \$2}" | sort')
        for i in `echo $HOSTS`; do mkdir hosts/x-$i 2>/dev/null || continue; echo $i; ssh $i ' ...'; done

    the mkdir is so that I can run the same command in many terminal
    windows and each host gets only one once

Batch jobs on all hosts
=======================

With that trick, a job can be ran on all hosts with
[parallel-ssh](https://code.google.com/archive/p/parallel-ssh/), for example, check the uptime:

    cut -d, -f1 hosts.hsv | parallel-ssh -i -h /dev/stdin uptime

This would do the same, but only on physical servers:

    grep 'physical$' hosts.hsv | cut -d -f1 | parallel-ssh -i -h /dev/stdin uptime

This would fetch the `/etc/motd` on all machines:

    cut -d -f1 hosts.csv | parallel-slurp -h /dev/stdin -L motd /etc/motd motd

To run batch commands through sudo that requires a password, you will need to fool both sudo and ssh a little more:

    cut -d -f1 hosts.csv | parallel-ssh -P -I -i -x -tt -h /dev/stdin -o pvs sudo pvs

You should then type your password then Control-d. Warning: this will
show your password on your terminal and probably in the logs as well.
