# Decommissioning a host

 1. remove the host from `tor-nagios/config/nagios-master.cfg`
 2. if applicable, stop the VM: `virsh destroy $host`
 3. if applicable, undefine it: `virsh undefine $host`
 4. if applicable, remove the LVM logical volumes or virtual disk files
 5. remove it from ud-ldap: the host entry and any `@<host>` group memberships there might be as well as any `sudo` passwords users might have configured for that host
 6. if it has any associated records in `tor-dns/domains` or `auto-dns`, or upstream's reverse dns thing, remove it from there too
 7. on pauli: `read host ; puppet node clean $host.torproject.org && puppet node deactivate $host.torproject.org`
 8. grep the `tor-puppet` repo for the host (and maybe its IP addresses) and clean up
 9. clean host from `tor-passwords`
 10. remove from the machine from the [Nextcloud spreadsheet](https://nc.riseup.net/remote.php/webdav/tpa/Tor%20VM%20Hosts.xlsx)
