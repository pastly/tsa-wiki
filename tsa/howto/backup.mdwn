[[!meta title="Backup and restore procedures"]]

Design
======

Backups are configured automatically by Puppet on all nodes, and use
[Bacula](https://www.bacula.org/) with TLS encryption over the wire. 

Backups are *pulled* from machines to the backup server, which means a
compromise on a machine shouldn't allow an attacker to delete backups
from the backup server.

Bacula splits the different responsabilities of the backup system
among multiple components, namely:

 * storage daemon (`bacula::storage` in Puppet, currently `bungei`)
 * director (`bacula::director` in Puppet, currently `dictyotum`)
 * file daemon (`bacula::client`, on all nodes)

<img src="https://www.bacula.org/9.4.x-manuals/en/images/bacula-applications.png" />

In our configuration, the *Admin workstation*, *Database server*and
*Backup server* are all on the same machine, the `bacula::director`.

See the [introductio to Bacula](https://www.bacula.org/9.4.x-manuals/en/main/What_is_Bacula.html#SECTION00220000000000000000) for more information on those
distinctions.

Basic commands
==============

Most work on Bacula happens on the **director**, which is where
backups are coordinated. Actual data is stored on the **storage
daemon**, but the director is where we can issue commands and
everything. 

All commands below are ran from the `bconsole` shell, which can be ran
on the director with:

```
root@dictyotum:~# bconsole 
Connecting to Director dictyotum.torproject.org:9101
1000 OK: 103 torproject-dir Version: 9.4.2 (04 February 2019)
Enter a period to cancel a command.
*
```

Then you end up with a shell with `*` as a prompt where you can issue
commands.

## Last jobs

To see the last jobs ran, you can check the status of the director:

```
*status director

```

Here we see that no backups are running, and the last ones succeeded correctly.

You can also check the status of individual clients with `status
client`.

Messages
--------

The `messages` command shows the latest messages on the
`bconsole`. It's useful to run this command when you start your
session as it will flush the (usually quite long) buffer of
messages. That way the next time you call the command, you will only
see the result of your latest jobs.

Restore procedures
==================

Short version:

    $ ssh -tt dictyotum.torproject.org bconsole
    *restore

... and follow instructions. Reminder: by default, backups are
restored on the originating server. `llist jobid=N` and `messages` to
follow progress.

The `bconsole` program has a pretty good interactive restore mode
which you can just call with `restore`. It needs to know which "jobs"
you want to restore from. As a given backup job is typically an
incremental job, you normally mean multiple jobs to restore to a given
point in time.

The first thing to know is that restores are done from the server to
the client, ie. they are restored directly on the machine that is
backed up. This means it can overwrite existing files and are
therefore pretty powerful.

A simple way of restoring a given client to a given point in time is
to use the  option. So:

 1. enter `bconsole` in a shell on the director
 
 2. call the `restore` command:

        *restore
        Automatically selected Catalog: MyCatalog
        Using Catalog "MyCatalog"
        
        First you select one or more JobIds that contain files
        to be restored. You will be presented several methods
        of specifying the JobIds. Then you will be allowed to
        select which files from those JobIds are to be restored.

 3. you now have a list of possible ways of restoring, choose: `5:
    Select the most recent backup for a client`:

        To select the JobIds, you have the following choices:
             1: List last 20 Jobs run
             2: List Jobs where a given File is saved
             3: Enter list of comma separated JobIds to select
             4: Enter SQL list command
             5: Select the most recent backup for a client
             6: Select backup for a client before a specified time
             7: Enter a list of files to restore
             8: Enter a list of files to restore before a specified time
             9: Find the JobIds of the most recent backup for a client
            10: Find the JobIds for a backup for a client before a specified time
            11: Enter a list of directories to restore for found JobIds
            12: Select full restore to a specified Job date
            13: Cancel
        Select item:  (1-13): 5

 4. you will see a list of machines, pick the machine you want to
    restore from by entering its number:

        Defined Clients:
             1: alberti.torproject.org-fd
        [...]
           117: yatei.torproject.org-fd
        Select the Client (1-117): 87

 5. you now get dropped in a file browser where you use the `mark` and
    `unmark` commands to mark and unmark files for restore. the
    commands support wildcards like `*`. use `mark *` to mark all
    files in the current directory, see also the [full list of
    commands](https://www.bacula.org/9.4.x-manuals/en/main/Restore_Command.html#SECTION0026130000000000000000):

         comment: 

The `JobStatus` column is an internal database field that will show
`T` ("terminated normally") when completed or `R` or `C` when still
running or not started, and anything else if, well, anything else is
happening. The full list of possible statuses is [hidden deep in the
developer documentation](https://www.bacula.org/9.4.x-manuals/en/developers/Catalog_Services.html#SECTION001015000000000000000), obviously.

The `messages` command also provides for a good way of showing the
latest status, although it will flood your terminal if it wasn't ran
for a long time. You can hit "enter" to see if there are new messages.
