How to get a new Tor System Administrator on board
==================================================

## Glossary

 * TSA: Tor System Administrators
 * TPA: Tor Project Admins, synonymous with TSA?
 * TPO: TorProject.Org, machines officially managed by TSA
 * TPN? torproject.net, machines in DNS but not officially managed by TSA
 * a sysadmin can also be a service admin, and both can be paid work

## Accounts required for a sysadmin

 1. LDAP (see [[tsa/doc/accounts]]), which includes SSH
    access (see [[tsa/doc/ssh-jump-host/]]). person will receive an
    email that looks like:
    
        Subject: New ud-ldap account for <your name here>
    
    and includes information about how to configure email forwarding
    and SSH keys

 2. tor-internal@ and other mailing lists (also see below)

 3. [[puppet]] git repository in `ssh://pauli.torproject.org/srv/puppet.torproject.org/git/tor-puppet`
    
 4. Trac: passwords in `troodi:/srv/trac.torproject.org/trac-var/trac.users`

 5. TPA password manager is in `ssh://git@git-rw.torproject.org/admin/tor-passwords.git`

 6. RT: find the password in `hosts-extra-info` in the password
    manager, login as root and create an account member of `rt-admin`
    
 7. [[nagios]] access, contact should be created in
    `ssh://git@git-rw.torproject.org/admin/tor-nagios`, password in
    `/etc/icinga/htpasswd.users` directly on the server

 8. this wiki: `git@git-rw.torproject.org:project/help/wiki.git`

 9. bio + avatar on: <https://torproject.org/about/people>

 10. ask linus to get access for the new sysadmin in the sunet cloud
     (e.g. `Message-ID: <87bm1gb5wk.fsf@nordberg.se>`)

## Orienteering

 * sysadmin (this) wiki: <https://help.torproject.org/tsa/>
 * list of services:
   <https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/operations/Infrastructure>
   (not the purview of TSA directly, but maye be interesting)
 * TPO machines list: <https://db.torproject.org/machines.cgi>, key machines:
   * puppet: `pauli`
   * [[jump host|tsa/doc/ssh-jump-host]]: `perdulce` or `peninsulare` on some hosts
   * nagios: `hetzner-hel1-01.torproject.org`
   * LDAP: `alberti`
 * key services:
   * git: <https://gitweb.torproject.org/>, or `git@git-rw.torproject.org` over SSH
   * trac: <https://trac.torproject.org/> - issue tracking and project management
   * RT: <https://rt.torproject.org/> - not really used by TSA yet
   * spec: <https://spec.torproject.org/> - for a series of permalinks
     to use everywhere, including especially `bugs.tpo/NNN`
 * key mailing lists:
   * <tor-project@lists.torproject.org> - Open list where anyone is welcome to watch but posting is moderated. Please favor using this when you can.
   * <tor-internal@lists.torproject.org> - If something truly can't include the wider community then this is the spot.
   * <tor-team@lists.torproject.org> - Exact same as tor-internal@ except that the list will accept email from non-members. If you need a cc when emailing a non-tor person then this is the place.
   * <tor-employees@lists.torproject.org> - TPI staff mailing list
   * <tor-meeting@lists.torproject.org> - for public meetings
   * <torproject-admin@torproject.org> - TPA-specific mailing list,
     not a mailing list but an alias
 * IRC channels:
   * `#tor-project` - general torproject channel
   * `#tpo-admin` - channel for TPA specific stuff
   * `#tor-internal` - channel for private discussions, need secret
     password and being added to the `@tor-tpomember` with GroupServ,
     part of the `tor-internal@lists.tpo` welcome email)
   * `#tor-bots` - where a lot of bots live
   * `#tor-nagios` ... except the nagios bot, which lives here
   * `#tor-meeting` - where some meetings are held
   * `#tor-meeting2` - fallback for the above
 * TPI stuff: see employee handbook from HR
