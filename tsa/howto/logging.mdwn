Logging is a pervasive service across all other services. It consist
of writing information to a (usually text) file and is generally
handled by a program called `syslog` (currently `syslog-ng`) that
takes logs through a socket or the network and writes them to
files. Other software might also write their own logfiles, for example
webservers do not write log files to syslog for performance reasons.

There's also a logging server that collects all those logfiles in a
central location.

How-to
======

Lnav log parsing
----------------

[lnav](https://lnav.org/) is a powerful log parser that allows you to do interesting
things on logfiles.

On any logfile, you can see per-second hit ratio by using the
"histogram" view.  Hit the `i` button to flip to the "histogram" view
and `z` multiple times to zoom all the way into a per-second hit rate
view. Hit `q` to go back to the normal view.

The `lnav` Puppet module can be used to install lnav and
formats. Formats should be stored in the lnav module to make it easier
to collaborate with the community.

Extending lnav formats
----------------------

Known formats:

 * [aspiers' formats](https://github.com/aspiers/lnav-formats) - many formats: zsh, bash history, alogcat,
   chef, oslo
 * [hagfelsh's formats](https://github.com/hagfelsh/lnav_formats) - many formats
 * [PaulWay's formats](https://github.com/PaulWay/lnav-formats) - many formats: openldap, exim, strace,
   squid, etc
 * [ruby-logger](https://github.com/penntaylor/lnav-ruby-logger-format)

lnav also ships with its own set of [default log formats](https://lnav.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#log-formats),
available in the source in [`src/default-log-formats.json`](https://github.com/tstack/lnav/blob/master/src/default-log-formats.json). Those
can be useful to extend existing log formats.
