# Creating a new user (for a human being)
- on laptop
  - verify pgp key
  - add pgp key to admin/account-keyring and git push to both torgit and
    alberti.torproject.org/srv/db.torproject.org/keyrings/keyring.git
- on alberti, as a user with LDAP write access
  - ud-useradd -n
  - sudo -u sshdist ud-generate && sudo -H ud-replicate
- on eugeni
  - sudo -H ud-replicate
  - egrep -q $new_login /etc/postfix/debian || echo "hmm, new user missing, please fix"
  - sudo puppet agent -t

# Creating a role acount and a group for it

1. Do _not_ use ud-groupadd and ud-roleadd. They are partly broken.

2. On LDAP host (currently alberti.tpo), as a user with LDAP write access, do
  - `ldapvi -ZZ --encoding=ASCII --ldap-conf -h db.torproject.org -D uid=${USER},ou=users,dc=torproject,dc=org`
  - Cut and paste a gid entry, pick a nice gidNumber.
  - Cut and paste a uid entry, pick a nice uidNumber.
  - Add 'allowedGroups: NEW-GROUP' to host entry/ies that should have
    this role account.
3. `sudo -u sshdist ud-generate && sudo -H ud-replicate`
