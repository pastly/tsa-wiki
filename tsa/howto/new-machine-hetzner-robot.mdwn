How to install a new bare metal server at Hetzner
=================================================

Order
-----

 1. get approval for the server, picking the specs from the [main
 website](https://www.hetzner.com/)

 2. head to the [order page](https://robot.your-server.de/order) and pick the right server. pay close
    attention to the location, you might want to put it alongside
    other TPO servers (or not!) depending on redundancy or traffic
    requirements. Click `Add to shopping cart`, leaving all other
    fields as default.

 3. in the `Server login details` page, you should leave `Type` set to
    `Public key`. If you do not recognize your public SSH key in
    there, head to the [server list](https://robot.your-server.de/server) and click on [key
    management](https://robot.your-server.de/key/index) to add your public keys

 4. when you're certain of everything, click `Checkout` in the cart,
    review the order again and click `Order in obligation`.

A confirmation email will be sent by Hetzner at the TPA alias when the
order is filed. Then you wait for the order to complete before being
able to proceed with the install.

Ordering physical servers from Hetzner can be very fast: we've seen 2
minutes turn around times.

Install
-------

At this point you should have received an email from Hetzner with a
subject like:

    Subject: Your ordered SX62 server

It should contain the SSH fingerprint, and IP address of the new host
which we'll use below.

 1. login to the server using the IP address and host key hash
    provided above:
 
        ssh -o FingerprintHash=md5 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null root@159.69.63.226

    Note: the `FingerprintHash` parameter above is to make sure we
    match the hashing algorithm used by Hetzner in their email, which
    is, at the time of writing, MD5 (!). Newer versions of SSH will
    also encode the hash as base64 instead of hexadecimal, so you
    might want to decode the base64 into the latter using this: The
    `UserKnownHostsFile` is to make sure we don't store the
    (temporary) SSH host key.
    
        perl -MMIME::Base64 -e '$h = unpack("H*", decode_base64(<>)); $h =~ s/(..)(?=.)/\1:/g; print $h, "\n"'

 2. magic.

Configuration
-------------
